# ft_printf

Hey! This is my implementation of the ft_printf project from 42 school, with the mandatory and bonus part!.  

The idea is simple, implement in some levels the well known function printf, from the stdio library.  

This project is the first with a very open approach in the way that you can struct your files inside your respository. It was also a good opportunity to learn the concept of variadic functions in c, and more about Makefiles and structs.  

Build the mandatory part:
```
make 
```

Build the bonus part:
```
make bonus
```
